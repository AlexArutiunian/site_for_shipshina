                Cheese in goat abomasum is little known outside the islands of Sardinia. Outwardly, it looks like a bag made of a material of unknown origin, soft and greasy. On palpation, it has the same consistency as the soft, sagging chest of an octogenarian.
                "Here's another stinky and wormy crap!"

                (Yes, I'm just quoting you, picky and biased reader.)
                Not at all. Cheese in goat abomasum does not smell like rotten cheese and does not contain worms, it smells like Sunday morning and contains gastric juice.

            <p class="desc">
                Inside the rennet, a special phenomenon occurs: thanks to certain enzymes and yeasts naturally present inside, the formation of rennet occurs, which turns curdled milk into cheese without heating, adding any ferments, salt or other substances. Only rennet and milk.

                Cheese in goat abomasum is usually served at the end of the meal. Having a pH close to 0.2, it is considered a true digestif. Its taste is indescribable: the receptors, in contact with it, go on strike and refuse to send signals to the brain. The aftertaste, which lingers after several hours, is reminiscent of hints of cod and custard with hints of nutmeg and opossum pie. Everything is so spicy that the Scoville scale would hide in shame.

                The casu de crabitta is placed on a cutting board and opened surgically by making a longitudinal incision with a pointed knife. The cream inside is spread on caracau bread, pistocca or fingers. It is completely useless to mix it or combine it with other products, as its pronounced and spicy taste overwhelms even truffles sprinkled with kerosene. You will most likely also have to drink a few glasses of good wine afterward. If you have high alcohol abbardente or grappa, that's even better.
                It is advisable not to drive after eating. It is also advisable to go to bed.

                Young cow's milk cheese is a completely raw product without added salt, enzymes and without heating. Ingredients: 100% milk, which retains a maximum of useful substances and turns into cheese with the help of bacteria that independently develop in the product itself.

                It is believed that milk heated above 39°C already loses most of its beneficial properties.

                Young unsalted cow's milk cheese, being young (from a couple of days to a couple of weeks) is an excellent source of minerals, it is best eaten with honey.
                If such cheese is kept and dried for a couple of months, it acts like a sponge on an empty stomach and absorbs harmful substances and toxins in the intestines. It can be eaten in small pieces during the day.
